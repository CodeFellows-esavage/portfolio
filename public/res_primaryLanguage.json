      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erik Savage. Prior to my head first dive into Software Development, I spent 10+ years working as a Design/Manufacturing Engineer in the Automotive and Consumer Electronic industries. My pivot to Software Development was initiated as my rigorous travel schedule was rebooted once I was fully vaccinated after spending over a year at home with my family. I bring an engineering mindset, track record of success, ability to drive ambiguous projects, and affinity for solving complex problems to Software Development. I am looking forward to working as part of a team for an ethical company that values people, equal opportunity and diversity.",
